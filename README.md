# Makeshift Mask Viral Safety Simulation

## Colors:
* Blue = Fabric/Thread
* Green = Mucus without Viral particles
* Red = Mucus **with** Viral particles


## Sizes:
According to this wiki article: [Coronavirus]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus): "The diameter of the virus particles is around 120 nm." (0.12 microns)

1 pixel = 1 micron (1/1000000 meters) which is the "base unit" of mesure used in this simulation - meaning that up to  (1 / ~0.12 = ~8.33 * ~8.33 * ~8.33 = ~578.009537)  viral particles can fit in each 1 pixel red dot.

The largest unit used is 1".

1 micron is about ~0.0000393701 inches (smaller than you can see) for reference, human hair is between 15 to 180 microns.
